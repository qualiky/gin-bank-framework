# SimpleBank

SimpleBank is a mockup of bank server written in Golang using the Gin framework.

The application utilises internal and third party Go libraries such as Gomock, Viper, sqlc, and more to create a backend server for a bank.
The API aims for 100% test coverage across the entire product with transaction, retries, API safety and more as we see on [API Safety on roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/best-practices/api-security). 

The application is deployed on a dockerized container in AWS (I aim to learn Sailfish here, but let's see).

It uses Postgres as DB, preferably to be hosted on AWS RDS.

Github Actions to be utilised for automated tests.

I will update this as much as possible. A longgg road ahead.

Off we go ðŸš€
